# PolarCare

# Polar Care is an app which addresses the negative impacts of climate change on polar bears. the goal of this app is to motivate users to walk and bike instead of using a car to counteract melting sea ice.

# The program is written in python. you can download python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
# The python file that you will need to run is called "PolarCare" (GFX-20180420T151239Z-001 > GFX)
# After running the program, a window will open. there are 2 buttons, "start timer" and "store"
# Press on "start timer" once you have started walking/biking. Whenever you have reached your destination, you can press "end timer". your total minutes will be displayed and you will be rewarded with virtual "money" per each minute (displayed in the bottom right corner). For demo purposes, the initial coins are set to $75, however
# After 2 seconds, the program will return you to the main menu. You can choose to spend your earned "money" in the store. 
# In the store menu, there are 4 buttons, you could choose to "donate". This will re-direct you to a web address for donating to Polar Bears International, the only organization solely dedicated to polar bears!
# The "bear fact" button will open a new window which displayed facts that will raise awareness about the problems polar bears are facing due to climate change. The window will automatically close after 5 seconds
# The "mini game" button is aimed to visualize the problems polar bears are facing through an interactive mini game. The new window will include instructions on how to play the game. All you will need to do is to click on the seals to catch them. After the game is over, the window will automatically close.
